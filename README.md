# SAHWebsite - Humber 5204 Group 5 - Group Members: Will Midgette, Ikumi Mine, Danyal Effendi, Bakary Diarra, Barbara Cam, Mahsa Fard

## This is a school project. Our group of 6 members has proposed new changes to the SAH hospital website in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario. These changes are structured at the MVP level in this submissn, in which each group member is creating CRUD functionality for 2 database entities. 
 
### Will - Chats and Messages database entities 
- For the MVP I have created CRUD functionality for the chat and messages entities. A user can create, read and/or delete a chat. A user can read, update, create and/or delete a message. The details view for a chat shows all of the messages associated with a chat. This essentially doubles as the list view for messages.
